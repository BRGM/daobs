# Overview

Collect information and configure indicators to generate reporting. Build dashboards using the online creation tools. Share your dashboards and provide access to all monitoring information. This project is using [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and [Banana](https://github.com/LucidWorks/banana) dashboard tool to analyze geospatial metadata catalog content.


* Advanced full-text search capabilities
* Create, share and visualize online dashboards
* Collect information using the OGC CSW standard
* Generate configurable reports


# User guide

The guide for user installing and configuring the application.

## Requirements

* Git
* Java 7
* Maven 3

## Installing the application

Clone and compile the application:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/titellus/daobs.git
cd daobs
mvn clean install
```


Starting web application:

```
cd web
mvn tomcat7:run-war
```

Access the home page from http://localhost:8983/solr.


### Configure security

Administration pages are accessible only to non anonymous users.

By default, only one user is defined with username "admin" and password "admin". To add more user, configuration is made in WEB-INF/config-security-ba.xml.

## Other building options

### Building the application in debug mode

For developpers, the application could be built in debug mode in order to have the banana project installed without Javascript minification. For this disable the production profile:

```
mvn clean install -P\!production
```

### Building the application without test

The tests rely on some third party application (eg. INSPIRE validator). It may be useful to build the application without testing:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```


## Search engine architecture


2 Solr cores are created:
* one for storing dashboards
* one for storing metadata records and indicators


## Importing metadata records or indicators
 
2 types of information can be loaded into the system:

* Metadata records following the standard for metadata on geographic information ISO19139/119
* Indicators in [INSPIRE monitoring reporting format](http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/monitoringreporting/monitoring.xsd)



### Harvesting records

#### Harvester configuration

An harvester engine provides the capability to harvest metadata records from discovery service (CSW end-point). The list of nodes to harvest is configured in src/main/resources/config-harvester.xml.


The configuration parameters are:
* territory: A representative geographic area for the node
* folder: The folder name where harvested records are stored
* name: The name of the node
* url: The server URL to request (should provide GetCapabilities and GetRecords operations)
* filter: (Optional) A OGC filter to restrict the search to a subset of the catalog


Example:

```
<harvester>
  <territory>de</territory>
  <folder>de</folder>
  <name>GeoDatenKatalog.De</name>
  <url>http://ims.geoportal.de/inspire/srv/eng/csw</url>
  <filter>
    <ogc:Filter xmlns:ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc">
      <ogc:PropertyIsLike escapeChar="\" singleChar="?" wildCard="*">
        <ogc:PropertyName>AnyText</ogc:PropertyName>
        <ogc:Literal>inspireidentifiziert</ogc:Literal>
      </ogc:PropertyIsLike>
    </ogc:Filter>
  </filter>
</harvester>
```

#### Running harvester

Harvesting records from a CSW end-point:

```
cd harvesters
mvn camel:run
```

#### Harvester details

[Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) integration framework based on Enterprise Integration Patterns is used to easily create configurable harvesters by defining routing and mediation rules.

The CSW harvester strategy is the following:
* GetRecords to retrieve the number of metadata to be harvested
* Compute paging information
* GetRecords for each pages and index the results in Solr.


While harvesting the GetRecords query and response are saved on disk. A log file return detailed information about the current process.


Harvesting is multithreaded on endpoint basis. By default, configuration is 11 threads across harvesters which means no multithreaded requests on the same server but 11 nodes could be harvested in parallel. 



### Indexing records

Metadata records and indicators could be manually loaded using Solr API by importing XML files.


Manually index XML records:

```
# Load file in current directory
for f in *.xml; do
  echo "importing '$f' file..";
  curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/data/update/xslt?commit=true&tr=metadata-iso19139.xsl" \
     -u username:password \
     -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" \
     --data-binary @$f
done


# Load files in all subfolders
find . -name *.xml -type f |
while read f
do
  echo "importing '$f' file..";
  curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/data/update/xslt?commit=true&tr=metadata-iso19139.xsl" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" --data-binary @$f
done

or 

for f in *.xml; do
  echo "importing '$f' file..";
  curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/data/update/xslt?commit=true&tr=metadata-iso19139.xsl" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" --data-binary @$f
done
```


### Indexing INSPIRE indicators


Manually indexing INSPIRE monitoring reporting (reporting could also contains ancillary information):

```
for f in *.xml; do
  echo "importing '$f' file..";
  curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/data/update/xslt?commit=true&tr=inspire-monitoring-reporting.xsl" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" --data-binary @$f
done
```

Manually dropped all records:
```
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/data/update \
    --data '<delete><query>documentType:*</query></delete>' \
    -u admin:admin \
    -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8'

curl http://localhost:8983/solr/data/update \
    --data '<commit/>' \
    -u admin:admin \
    -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8'
```




## Analysis tasks

A set of background tasks could be triggered on the content of the index and improve or add information to the index.

### Validation task

#### Process

A two steps validation task is defined:

* XML Schema validation
* INSPIRE validator (http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/validator2/#)

The results and details of the validation process are stored in the index:

* For INSPIRE validation:
 * isValid: Boolean
 * validDate: Date of validation
 * validReport: XML report returned by the validation service
 * validInfo: Text information about the status
* For XML Schema validation:
 * isSchemaValid: Boolean
 * schemaValidDate: The date of validation
 * schemaValidReport: XSD validation report


#### Run the task

To trigger the validation:

```
cd tasks/validation-checker
mvn camel:run
```

By default, the task validates all records which have not been validated before (ie. +documentType:metadata -isValid:[* TO *]). A custom set of records could be validated by changing the solr.select.filter in the config.properties file.


### Services and data sets link

#### Process

A data sets may be accessible through a view and/or download services. This type of relation is defined at the service metadata level using the operatesOn element:

* link using the data sets metadata record UUID:

```
<srv:operatesOn uuidref="81aea739-4d21-427d-bec4-082cb64b825b"/>
```

* link using a GetRecordById request:
```
<srv:operatesOn uuidref="BDML_NATURES_FOND"
                xlink:href="http://services.data.shom.fr/csw/ISOAP?service=CSW&amp;version=2.0.2&amp;request=GetRecordById&amp;Id=81aea739-4d21-427d-bec4-082cb64b825b"/>
```

Both type of links are supported. The GetRecordById takes priority. The data sets metadata record identifier is extracted from the GetRecordById request.



This task analyze all available services in the index and update associated data sets by adding the following fields:

* recordOperatedByType: Contains the type of all services operating the data sets (eg. view, download)
* recordOperatedBy: Contains the identifier of all services operating the data sets. Note: it does not provide information that this service is a download service. User need to get the service record to get this details.


#### Run the task

To trigger the validation:

```
cd tasks/service-dataset-indexer
mvn camel:run
```

By default, the task analyze all services.


## Loading dashboards

Access the dashboard page, click load and choose dashboard configuration from the list. 
If no dashboards are available sample dashboard are available here: dashboard/src/app/dashboards

* Browse: Search for metadata records and filter your search easily (facets, INSPIRE themes and annexes charts).
* INSPIRE-Dashboard: Home page
* default: Monitoring reporting 2013 dashboard




## Configuring reports

Report configuration is made web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/reporting.
One or more configuration file can be created in this folder. The file name should follow the pattern "config-<report_id>.xml".

A report is created from a set of variables and indicators. Variables are defined using query expressions to be computed by the search engine. Indicators are created from mathematical expressions based on variables.
